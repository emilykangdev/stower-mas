# Stower — Agent Conventions

Canonical rule set for every AI coding agent in this repo (Claude Code, Codex,
and any other). `CLAUDE.md` imports this file with `@AGENTS.md`; do not duplicate
rules there.

You are working in a Swift monorepo for an always-local AI recall app.
Apply the following constraints to every change you make.

USE CONTEXT.md to describe objects and relationships for this specific codebase when explaining designs. 
Besides general SWE concepts, don't make up or arbitrarily decide on words to explain objects or relationships in this codebase.

## Architecture rules

- Do not import `StowerPhotos` or `StowerMessages` from `StowerCore`.
  Dependency arrows point INTO StowerCore, never out of it.
- Do not import `StowerMessages` from `StowerPhotos`, or `StowerPhotos` from
  `StowerMessages`. The adapters never know about each other.
- Do not introduce a fourth source adapter in `Sources/`. New data sources go
  through a discussion + brief + plan before any module is created.
- Do not add a generic `Utilities` or `Common` module. Shared code goes in
  `StowerCore`.
- Do not bypass `StowerCore`'s `IndexedItem` protocol when adding records to
  the search index. Adapters produce IndexedItems; the index never imports
  PhotoKit or `chat.db`-specific GRDB types.

## Swift style

- Do not use `try!` or force-unwrap (`!`). Use `guard let` or `try` with
  explicit error handling.
- Do not omit doc comments on `public` declarations. Triple-slash only;
  no `/** */` blocks.
- Do not use `XCTest` for new tests. Use Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`).
- Do not name a test with a bare camelCase behavioral name or a `test` prefix. Every
  `@Test` carries a `("…")` display string describing ONE behavior as a present-tense
  sentence (tag the invariant it guards, e.g. `(I5)`); a `@Suite`'s display string, when
  present, is a short noun **label** for the type/subsystem under test (e.g.
  `"StowerDiagnosticsConsent"`), not a sentence. The `func`/`struct` name is a short
  label, not the description. Full standard + rationale: `Docs/Tests.md`.
- Do not exceed function body length 40 lines or cyclomatic complexity 8
  without a `// swiftlint:disable:next` comment that explains why.
- Do not use real Photos or Messages data in test fixtures, prompts, debug
  logs, or network calls.
- Do not use magic numbers/literals or global/file-scope constants. Define a
  constant as a named `static let` on the type it naturally belongs to, scoped
  to the narrowest access (`private` → `internal` → `public`) and co-located with
  its use (e.g. `StowerConversationStateExtractor.reciprocityWindowDays`,
  `StowerCoreMLEmbedder.maxBatch`). Use `Duration` for time intervals. Only
  introduce a case-less `enum` namespace for a *bag of homeless* constants with no
  natural home type — never a `Constants.swift` dumping ground.

## Process

- Do not refactor unrelated code while implementing a feature. One commit,
  one concern.
- Do not skip `Scripts/precheck.sh`. If it fails, fix the cause, do not
  comment out the rule.
- Do not bypass `git commit` hooks with `--no-verify`.
- Do not modify `Package.resolved` directly. Run `swift package update`.

## Static source guards (`precheck.sh` `6x` family)

Some invariants are enforced by asserting a textual/structural fact about the
source tree at gate time — *"X is/isn't present, here"* — rather than by a unit
test. They live as numbered `# 6x — WHAT, WHY` blocks in `Scripts/precheck.sh`,
each a single check that does `echo "ERROR: <what + how to fix>" >&2; exit 1` on
violation, anchored to real call sites (so a stray word in a comment can't trip
it).

Add a new one as the **next member of this family — never a parallel mechanism.**
Pick the tool by the assertion's shape:

- **grep** (`grep -RInE`) when the fact is **line-local** — a token's
  presence/absence anywhere in the paths.
- **awk** when the fact depends on **region or block structure** — "only inside a
  `#if DEBUG` region," "only inside a named pbxproj `XCBuildConfiguration` block."
  grep is line-oriented and cannot track which region a line is in.

**Polarity** is just which outcome trips `exit 1`: must-be-**absent** → a *match*
fails (the default); must-be-**present** → a *no-match* fails
(`grep -q … || { echo "ERROR: …" >&2; exit 1; }`).

No external deps (no plutil/jq/python) — these run on every commit.

## Out of scope for v1

- Do not write any reply-**sending** code: no AppleScript `send`, no IMCore, no
  synthetic Return/Enter, no programmatic message transmission of any kind.
  **Populating** the Messages compose field for the user to send manually IS
  allowed (the drafts feature copies the draft to the clipboard, opens the
  conversation, and posts a synthetic ⌘V — never a Return). v1 stays send-free.
- Do not pull in Hummingbird, swift-nio, or any HTTP server dependency.
  v2 territory.
- Do not read or write face-identity tables in `Photos.sqlite` (ZPERSON,
  ZDETECTEDFACE). If photo indexing is ever built (see "Photos — two different
  features" below), it uses PhotoKit + FastVLM captions, never those tables.

## Photos — two different features, do not conflate them

"Photos" means two unrelated things in Stower. Keep them separate in scope and in
code:

- **Photo *indexing / recall*** — the `StowerPhotos` adapter reading the user's photo
  library via PhotoKit and captioning it with FastVLM so photos become a searchable
  source (today `Sources/StowerPhotos` is only a scaffold). This is **uncertain and
  currently unlikely** — it hinges on unresolved technical details *and* product
  direction, and may never ship. Do not build toward it or assume it lands; leave
  `StowerPhotos` a scaffold until a discussion + brief + plan says otherwise.
- **Photo *attachment in a draft*** — letting the user **drag-and-drop a photo onto a
  draft** so it rides along into the Messages compose field. This is **in scope, cheap
  enough for v0**, and serves the core JTBD ("help me send a text" — real texts often
  include a photo). It needs **no** PhotoKit, no `StowerPhotos`, no library indexing:
  the photo is user-picked and delivered by the **same clipboard + synthetic ⌘V path**
  (`StowerMessagesDropper`) as a text draft — never a Return, so it stays send-free
  (see "Out of scope for v1"). Staging an attachment onto the pasteboard is
  *populating* the compose field, not sending — it sits inside that send-free
  carve-out. The one open build-to-learn detail: getting text **and** image into the
  field in one shot (multi-item pasteboard vs. a two-step paste) — verify empirically,
  don't assume.

## Conventions

- All public file-scope declarations in a `Stower*` module must begin with
  `Stower`, or be nested inside a type that does. Underscore-prefixed names
  are treated as internal API even if `public`.
- Tests go in `Tests/<ModuleName>Tests/`. One file per type under test.
- Subsystem rationale lives in `Docs/<Subsystem>.md`. Update it when the
  rationale changes — not when the code changes.
- After each meaningful commit, update `Docs/BuildLog.md`'s "Status" section so
  the next session can re-enter without re-reading the diff.
- When writing or editing a plan/spec/doc, refer to real codebase symbols
  (types, functions, views, state cases) by their **exact names** — e.g.
  `StowerModelUnavailableView`, not "the model screen". Invented English
  paraphrases drift out of sync and aren't greppable; exact names are. If the
  symbol doesn't exist yet, name the one you intend to create, not a vibe.
- **Naming map: product identity vs. internal structure — do not conflate them.**
  Two distinctions, both locked by `Scripts/precheck.sh`'s `6p` guard:
  1. **Product identity ≠ internal `StowerMac` structure.** The user-facing product
     name (`Stower`/`Stower Test`, the pbxproj's `PRODUCT_NAME` /
     `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` / `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName`) is
     independent of the internal
     `StowerMac` scheme, `StowerMac.xcodeproj`, and the `StowerMacUI` /
     `StowerCore` / `StowerMessages` / `StowerPhotos` SPM module names. Do
     **not** sweep `StowerMac → Stower` anywhere in scheme/project/module
     names — it breaks `-scheme StowerMacMAS` in `ci.yml` + `mas-release.yml`,
     every `import StowerMacUI`, and `precheck.sh`'s own path guards.
  2. **Within product identity, `PRODUCT_NAME` and the display name are
     deliberately different values — do not unify them.** `PRODUCT_NAME` stays
     space-free (`StowerTest` / `Stower`) because it drives the `.app` filename,
     the `Contents/MacOS/` binary name (`EXECUTABLE_NAME`), the run scripts'
     derivation (`Scripts/run-app.sh` / `run-app-demo.sh`), and the `6p` guard's
     `PRODUCT_NAME` match. `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName` carries the space
     (`"Stower Test"`) for the menu-bar/Finder label only. Unifying them would
     break the `awk -F ' = '` derivation and the guard.

## Signal-coding skills

These keep bad patterns from spreading. The skills live in `.claude/skills/`
(Claude Code's discovery path) and are mirrored to `.agents/skills/` via symlink so
Codex discovers them too. Any agent that does not auto-load skills should read and
follow the relevant `SKILL.md` directly. The bad→good pattern catalog is
`.claude/skills/SWIFT_PATTERNS.md` (single source of truth; read it before
reviewing or fixing Swift).

Run the full pattern pass once per branch, when you are about to open a PR — not on
every commit. Sweeping and hardening prompt the human, so running them mid-branch is
noise; batch them at PR time. (The mechanical gate, `precheck.sh`, still runs on every
commit.) Order matters — noticing comes before fixing:

1. Run `swift-signal-review` on the whole branch diff (`git diff origin/main...`) to
   notice the bad patterns in the changes you made.
2. For each noticed pattern the catalog marks `Sweep-able: yes`, run
   `swift-pattern-sweep` once to remove every instance repo-wide. Patterns marked
   `Sweep-able: no` (judgment/process/architectural) are fixed by hand, not swept.
3. For each pattern that also appears elsewhere in the codebase (recurs ≥2×), run
   `harden-guardrail`; it proposes test/CI enforcement and asks you how to lock the
   pattern down so it can't come back.

Do not add a new convention rule by hand — route it through `harden-guardrail` so it
lands as a gate first, an `AGENTS.md` rule only when it can't be mechanized, and gets
recorded in the catalog.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues (`emily-kang-llc/stower-mas`), via the `gh` CLI. See
`Docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, each label string equal to its name; `wontfix` already exists in
the repo, the other four need creating. See `Docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root (hand-edited — agents read it, never write it),
with `Docs/adr/` reserved for ADRs. See `Docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Codebase language alignment

Global, not here: `~/.agents/skills/align-codebase-language` reads the personal map
pointer in ignored `.agents/align-codebase-language.local.md`. Source and this repo's
own docs win over that map; `CONTEXT.md` stays hand-edited.
