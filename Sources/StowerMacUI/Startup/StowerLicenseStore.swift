/// from the response (notably `meta.customer_email`) is ever stored here.

/// `Codable` so `StowerLicenseStore` persists both fields as one encoded
/// record under a single `UserDefaults` key — a crash between two separate
/// writes can never leave a real activation's `key` stored without its
/// `instanceID` (or vice versa), which would make an already-activated
/// license look absent on the next launch.

/// token the user already holds in email, so this is an anti-casual-copy gate,
/// not tamper-proof storage (honest about the limitation).
