# Build-and-run StowerMac against the DEMO Messages database, never the real one.
#
# The app reads its board from a security-scoped bookmark by default. This script
# instead points a DEBUG build at the curated demo database via the DEBUG-only
# `STOWER_MESSAGES_DB` override (see StowerMessagesSourceOverride), so the
# relationship-debt board can be demoed/recorded WITHOUT swapping — and risking —
# your real Messages history.
#
# Unlike run-app.sh (which uses `open`, whose launchd path does not forward env
# vars), this launches the built binary directly so the env override reaches the
# app. Under App Sandbox (ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX=YES), the sandboxed process's own
# Application Support redirects into its container
# (~/Library/Containers/<bundle-id>/Data/Library/Application Support/) regardless
# of how the binary is launched — a literal unsandboxed-`$HOME` path computed in
# this script's shell would point outside the app's reachable region entirely, so
# DEMO_DB is computed container-relative below (derived the same way
# Scripts/lib/derive-app-paths.sh derives the built binary's other paths). The demo
# db needs no Messages access grant at all, so the direct launch raises no prompt.
#
# By default it regenerates the demo db first so its dates stay inside the board's
# in-window gates (>3 days old, <60-day reciprocity window) no matter when you run
# it. Pass --no-regen to launch against the existing file unchanged.
