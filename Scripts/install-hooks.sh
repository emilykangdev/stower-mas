# elsewhere).
# NOTE: --git-common-dir installs the hooks for ALL worktrees in this repo. The
# symlinks point to THIS worktree's Scripts/. If you later remove this worktree,
# the hooks break for others — re-run install-hooks.sh from any remaining worktree.
#
# Installs:
#   pre-commit -> Scripts/precheck.sh   (the hard mechanical gate, every commit)
# The advisory swift-signal-review is NOT a git hook — a push happens many times
# per branch, a PR once. Run it at PR time with Scripts/pre-pr.sh.
