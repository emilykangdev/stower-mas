# 6q — No Keychain-ITEM API in first-party Swift (Sources/ + StowerMac/StowerMac/).
#      The diagnostics install record lives in UserDefaults, not the Keychain: a
#      Keychain read on the launch path raised the macOS "allow access to your
#      keychain" dialog that BLOCKS the app from opening for cross-signature
#      upgraders. That read is removed; this guard keeps it from coming back.
#      SCOPE: keychain-item access only — SecItem*/SecKeychain* and the item-query
#      kSec* constants. Legit Security.framework use stays ALLOWED: `import Security`,
#      SecKey* (crypto), SecTrust* (TLS pinning), SecCertificate* (code-signing).
#      Tests/ is intentionally out of scope (test fixtures never ship). awk (not
#      grep) so a PURE-COMMENT line naming a banned token — a doc mention, not a
#      compile reference — cannot trip it (same idiom as debug_region_violation
#      above, and the AGENTS.md 6x-family rule: a stray word in a comment must not
#      fail the guard). Line-local token fact; no \b (BSD grep lacks it), explicit
#      tokens. Must-be-ABSENT polarity (a match on a NON-comment line fails).

# 6r — The Application-Support folder-name literals "Stower"/"StowerDebug"/

#      these files: StowerEnvironment.swift and StowerMessagesStorageLocation.swift,
#      the PAR-62 single source of truth for the name, plus two files with an
#      unrelated, confirmed-legitimate exact use of "Stower" — StowerCLISupport.swift's
#      own preserved CLI-only folder (excluded by the PAR-62 plan's Non-goals) and
#      StowerLemonSqueezyLicenseGate.swift's unrelated Lemon Squeezy `instance_name`

#      per-call-site drift PAR-62 closed — derive the folder name from
#      StowerEnvironment.current / StowerMessagesStorageLocation.current instead.
#      EXACT quoted-string match only (not a substring check) so this never trips on
#      the dozens of user-facing strings that merely mention "Stower" in a sentence
