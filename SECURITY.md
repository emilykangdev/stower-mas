# Security

Stower reads sensitive data on your Mac — your Messages database — so security
questions deserve a straight answer, not marketing. This page covers both: what
went wrong once, and what protects your data every day.

## Past incident: a real credential was briefly committed

**Yes, this happened, and here's exactly what.** On 2026-06-28, a real Keygen
API token (plus some internal account/product identifiers) was accidentally
committed inside a template file (`Scripts/Keygen/remote-testing/.env.example`)
that was meant to hold only placeholder values.

What we did about it, same day:
- Rotated the exposed token immediately — the old one stopped working.
- Replaced the template file with unmistakable placeholder values so this
  can't happen again from that file.
- Scrubbed the affected branch history.

Shortly after, we went further than just rotating the key — **we deleted the
entire backend system that credential belonged to** (the Keygen + Supabase
licensing service) and rebuilt licensing on Lemon Squeezy instead. So the
exposed credential isn't just rotated, it's connected to nothing — that
system no longer exists at all.

We also added a permanent, automated guardrail so this specific class of
mistake can't quietly come back: every commit is mechanically checked to
confirm there is **no remaining reference anywhere in the app's source code**
to the old Keygen/Supabase backend. If anyone (human or AI) ever tried to
reintroduce it, the commit would fail automatically, not rely on someone
noticing in review.

**No user data, license keys, or customer information was ever involved** —
the exposed token belonged to internal test tooling for the (now-deleted)
licensing backend, not to anyone's account or Messages data.

## Ongoing practices

- **Commits are signed going forward** (SSH-based commit signing), as of
  this recent change — this narrows who could plausibly author a *future*
  commit without access to that key. It is not retroactive: commits made
  before this change are not signed, and a "Verified" badge you may see on
  an older merge commit on GitHub reflects **GitHub's own signature on the
  merge action**, not proof that the maintainer signed the underlying
  commit.
- **Release tags are pushed using 1Password**-backed credentials, not a
  loose key sitting in a config file.
- **App update signing key was rotated** as a precaution after a separate,
  unrelated exposure risk — see `Docs/release-notes/` for the timeline. The
  old signing key can no longer authorize anything.
- Every GitHub Action used in the release pipeline is pinned to an exact
  commit (not a movable version tag), which **reduces** (not eliminates)
  the risk of a supply-chain attack where a third-party Action's behavior
  changes underneath a moving version tag.

## What's built into the product itself

This is the part that matters most day to day — how Stower is designed so
there's less to trust in the first place:

- **Your message content never leaves your Mac.** Stower reads your Messages
  database and runs its AI judgment (deciding whether a text is a real
  question worth following up on) entirely on-device. There is no server
  that ever sees the content of your messages, a contact name, a phone
  number, a search query, or a file path — the analytics event types below
  are structurally incapable of carrying any of that (see the
  `StowerAnalyticsEvent` doc comments; the MAS build additionally routes every
  event to a no-op reporter, so nothing is recorded or transmitted at all).
- **But Stower is not fully offline, and you should know exactly what does
  leave the device:**
  - **Lemon Squeezy** (`api.lemonsqueezy.com`) — the license check of the
    retired direct-distribution build. The Mac App Store build does not wire
    a license gate, so this call never happens there (the App Store handles
    purchase); the code path remains only as an inactive leftover. It was the
    only network call in the licensing path, and a mechanical build check
    confirms no other licensing backend can sneak back in (see the past
    incident above).
  - **Analytics: nothing.** The Mac App Store build ships no analytics SDK
    at all — every analytics event terminates in a no-op reporter, so no
    usage data is recorded or transmitted, ever. (The retired
    direct-distribution build used TelemetryDeck; the MAS target excludes
    that SDK entirely, and a mechanical build check keeps it out.)
  - **Crash reporting: nothing.** No crash-reporting SDK is present in the
    MAS build (see `Docs/CrashReporting.md` for the record of its removal).
  - **A feedback relay**, only if you explicitly open the in-app feedback
    form and submit something — this one is not default-on. Along with
    the message you type (and an email address, only if you choose to add
    one), it also sends a few non-content identifiers: your app version,
    macOS version, coarse license status (e.g. trial/licensed), and an
    opaque license-instance ID if you have one. No message content,
    contacts, or file paths ride along.
- **Read-only access.** Stower reads your Messages database; it does not
  and cannot send messages on your behalf. Replying is always a manual,
  deliberate action you take yourself in the real Messages app.
- **Access is scoped to exactly the folder you pick — nothing more.** Stower
  runs under macOS's App Sandbox and reads `chat.db` (where macOS stores your
  Messages) through a security-scoped bookmark: a standard "Open" dialog
  (`NSOpenPanel`) asks you to select your Messages folder, and macOS grants
  read access to only that folder — not your whole disk. Stower's onboarding
  screen walks you through this dialog the first time it needs access.
- **Separate, isolated environments for development and daily use.**
  The version of Stower used for active development/testing never shares
  its data with the version you actually use day to day, so a bug being
  tested can't accidentally corrupt or mix with your real drafts, message
  history, or settings.
- **The source is public.** Unlike most apps that ask for this level of
  access, you don't have to take a company's word for what it does with it —
  the code is readable at
  [github.com/emilykangdev/stower](https://github.com/emilykangdev/stower).
  (Public and free to read/audit/run for noncommercial use — see
  [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for the exact terms.)

## Reporting a concern

**Found something that could be exploited (a real vulnerability)?** Please
report it privately first — use GitHub's
["Report a vulnerability"](https://github.com/emilykangdev/stower/security/advisories/new)
(Security tab → Advisories) or reach out directly (see contact info on
[stower.app](https://stower.app)), rather than a public issue, so exploit
details aren't public before there's a fix.

For anything else — a question, a privacy concern, a doc that doesn't add
up — a [public GitHub issue](https://github.com/emilykangdev/stower/issues)
is completely fine. Genuine reports of either kind are welcome and taken
seriously.
